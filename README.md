# (Game Boy) Tetris, Disassembled

Yeah, another Tetris disassembly

WIP. Not even close to done. But the eventual goal is to have a thoroughly-commented and hackable disassembly of Tetris. And also to not get sued.

Build it yourself with [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/):

```sh
brew install rgbds
make
